### **MVP Description**

**Problem Statement:**  
Many third-party app integrations in the Square App Marketplace lack integration with a Seller's Loyalty program, precluding the ability to add loyalty points to existing accounts or create new loyalty accounts for transactions performed through these third-party systems.

**Target Audience:**  
Square Sellers who use third-party systems with limited integration with Square. These systems typically only send back Customer and Payment data. These Sellers want to enhance their loyalty programs by adding points for transactions made through third-party services and creating new loyalty accounts when necessary. These sellers also want to bolster their marketing ability using loyalty accounts.

**Core Value Proposition:**  
Our MVP will enable Square Sellers to seamlessly add loyalty points to existing customer accounts or create new loyalty accounts for transactions processed through third-party systems. This integration ensures that loyalty rewards are accurately tracked and managed across all transactions, enhancing customer retention and engagement, and enabling more marketing avenues.

**Essential Features:**
- **Add Loyalty Points:** Automatically add loyalty points to existing loyalty accounts for transactions made through third-party systems.
- **Create New Loyalty Accounts:** Automatically create new loyalty accounts for customers if they do not already have one when using the third-party service, then add loyalty points for that purchase.
- **Billing Information Collection:** Securely collect and store billing information from Sellers to manage app usage fees.

**Minimum Scope:**
- **Core Integration:** Focus on integrating with Square's API systems to perform the following:
  - Add loyalty points to existing accounts based on transaction data.
  - Create new loyalty accounts if the customer does not have one, then add loyalty points based on transaction data.
- **Billing Integration:** Implement a secure method for collecting and storing billing information.
- **Exclusions:** Advanced features like detailed analytics, marketing tools, or additional loyalty program integrations are not included in the initial MVP.

**Build and Design:**

- **User Interface:**
  - **Setup Interface:** A basic setup screen where users can configure the third-party system integration, view logs or status of loyalty actions, and manage billing information.

- **Implementation:**
  - **OAuth Integration:**
    - **Authentication Flow:** Implement OAuth authentication to allow users to connect their Square accounts. This includes:
      - **Authorization Request:** Redirect users to Square’s OAuth authorization endpoint to grant permissions.
      - **Token Exchange:** Handle the callback to exchange the authorization code for an access token.
      - **Token Storage:** Store the access token securely for making authenticated requests to Square’s APIs.
    - **Permissions Required:** Ensure the OAuth scopes include permissions to read payments and customer data, as well as to read and write loyalty data.
  
  - **Webhook Integration:**
    - **Webhook Listener:** Implement a listener for the `payment.updated` event from Square.
    - **Filter Transactions:** Filter transactions to ensure processing only updates from the third-party system.
    - **Loyalty Actions:** Based on the transaction update:
      - **Add Loyalty Points:** Use the Square Loyalty API to add points to existing accounts.
      - **Create New Loyalty Accounts:** Use the Loyalty API to create new accounts if they don’t exist.

  - **Billing Information:**
      - **Secure Collection:** Implement secure forms and storage for collecting billing information from Sellers.
      - **Compliance:** Ensure that billing information is stored in compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., PCI DSS).

  - **Error Handling:**
    - Implement error handling and logging to manage any issues with OAuth token management, webhook events, or API interactions.

  - **Technologies:**
    - **Backend:** Use Node.js or another suitable technology for handling OAuth flows, webhook events, and API interactions.
    - **Database:** Optionally use a database to track OAuth tokens, transaction logs, billing information, and integration status.

**Testing and Validation:**
- **OAuth Testing:** Test the OAuth flow to ensure users can connect their Square accounts and permissions are correctly granted.
- **Webhook Testing:** Simulate `payment.updated` events from Square to ensure the webhook listener processes these events correctly.
- **Billing Testing:** Verify that billing information is securely collected and stored, and that billing processes are functioning correctly.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the end-to-end flow of adding points, creating accounts, and managing billing works as expected with real and simulated data.

**Iteration and Improvement:**
- **Feedback Collection:** Collect feedback from initial users on functionality, integration process, and billing management.
- **Improvement Process:** Address issues reported by users and prioritize enhancements based on feedback. Refine the integration to ensure reliability and accuracy.

**Goals:**
- **Objectives:** Validate the functionality of adding points, creating accounts, and managing billing. Prove the value of the integration for loyalty programs and establish initial user satisfaction.
- **Success Measurement:** Successful execution of loyalty point additions, account creations, and billing processes, positive user feedback, and error-free operations.

**Future Plans:**
- **Additional Features:** Explore adding features such as detailed reporting, support for additional third-party systems, and access to opt-in data from third-party systems.
- **Scaling:** Enhance the product based on user feedback and market needs, expanding functionality and improving integration capabilities.
